        <h2>. . . to Worldwide</h2>
        <p>I have travelled through many countrys, but those two to follow are the ones which i most learned from.</p>
        <ul class="ultrip">
          <li> my favourite one :)<strong>Australia</strong> I've lived there for about 2 years. I fall in love with it, and all her beautifull aspects. I arrived there and all i had was a big smile, I didn't know how to speak English so i had to start from the beginnig.
            That helped me to open up, and I have been through many different situation and people who enrich myself of greats moment and teachings. 
          </li>
          <li> I was ready to come back home, I had skilled myself enough to going toward my new goals, when i met a person who became a bestfreind that opened a door i couldnt refuse to pass by. I end up from the Australian's beaches to the mountain's top in center America. I lived in USA for anorher year and half, a time of life changing experiences.

            <h2>About Tech</h2>
            <p>I started to get curious about programming for the fist time in US, I was leaving in a fried house who is a web developer, I was helping him to upgrading is farm and he was speaking to me about his job. I belive today's technologies are developing really fast and thanks to those we can empower people to improve their activities and built a more health and sustanible society.</p>
